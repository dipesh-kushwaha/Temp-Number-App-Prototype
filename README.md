# Temp-Number-App-Prototype
A responsive, dark-themed web application prototype simulating a Temporary SMS and Email receiver service for Nepal (NTC/Ncell). Built with Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.

# 🇳🇵 NepalTemp - Virtual SMS & Email Receiver UI

**NepalTemp** is a sleek, mobile-first web application prototype designed to simulate the experience of a Temporary Number (SMS) and Temporary Email service. It features a modern "Dark Mode" interface, premium unlocking mechanisms, and simulated real-time message updates.

> **Note:** This is a **frontend simulation/prototype**. It generates simulated OTPs and messages for UI demonstration purposes. It does not connect to real telecom networks.

*   **Simulated SMS Inbox:** auto-generates realistic OTP messages from popular services like eSewa, Khalti, Google, Facebook, NTC, and Ncell.
*   **Tiered Access System:**
    *   **Free Tier:** Access to standard public numbers.
    *   **VIP/Gold Tier:** UI for premium numbers (locked behind a mock payment gateway).
*   **Mock Payment Flow:** Includes a simulated eSewa payment modal and a password verification system to unlock "Premium" features.
*   **Temp Mail Generator:** A simulated inbox for temporary email addresses.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Toast notifications, copy-to-clipboard functionality, and animated message bubbles.
